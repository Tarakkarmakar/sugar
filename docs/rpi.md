Raspberry Pi are a series of small, low cost, low power computers.

Sugar can be run on a Raspberry Pi. You will need a display, keyboard and mouse.

Raspberry Pi OS
---------------

Raspberry Pi OS is a derivative of Debian.  Sugar can be installed using [Instructions for Debian](debian.md),

Fedora Sugar on a Stick
-----------------------

Sugar on a Stick has many activities and regular security updates. See [Sugar on a Stick](rpi-soas.md) for how to download and install it. Sugar on a Stick is a spin of Fedora.

(Developers may focus on either Fedora or Debian when [setting up a development environment](development-environment.md) for Sugar on Raspberry Pi, because Sugar development on generic computers is focused on those operating systems.)
